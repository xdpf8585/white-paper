# vision

The goal of PETO is to guide users, bring cryptocurrency enthusiasts and game enthusiasts together by governing token issuance and GamefI release, and provide a truly decentralized governance, communication, conversion and release platform for all Gamefi enthusiasts.

In the early stage, PETO took the lead in game development, management token issuance, update and maintenance. When the number of governance token holders reaches a certain level, PETO is only responsible for game update maintenance, token issuance, and corresponding game content addition. After owning the governance token, the user can do the following:

1、Governance tokens can be consumed to vote for proposals, including but not limited to game development, game scene addition, game tokens distribution, etc.

2、Users can vote on proposals using governance tokens or game tokens.

3、Transfer money through the platform.

4、Instant messaging and video Posting.

5、Reward your favorite content.

6、Release activities and tasks, etc.

7、Connect the new Gamefi to the PTEO platform through an open interface.

PETO hope that everyone will work together, and when the game, economy and application scenarios reach a certain quality and quantity, PETO will work together with everyone to make PETO a real metauniverse. Let the user become the holder of meta universe assets truly, the controller.
